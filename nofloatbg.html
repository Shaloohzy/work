    <h2>Computer</h2>
    <p>
        A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
         Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.
         </p>
         <p>
         These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
         </p>
         <p>
          A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation.
          </p>
          <p>
           This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
